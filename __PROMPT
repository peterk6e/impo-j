### ‚úÖ **Production Readiness Review Prompt (Next.js + REST API + SaaS)**

> **"Review this Next.js SaaS application to ensure it's production-ready. Evaluate all aspects of its architecture and implementation according to modern best practices for RESTful APIs, security, scalability, performance, and maintainability. Suggest or implement improvements where necessary‚Äîeven if that means recommending a complete restructuring. Focus on what's objectively best for a secure, maintainable, and scalable SaaS app in production."**

validate and optimize the app across the following key areas:

---

## üß± **Architecture (Next.js App Structure & Codebase)**

* Is the app using **App Router** (`app/`) or **Pages Router** (`pages/`) ‚Äî and is it the right choice for the project?
* Is the code **modular** and separated by domain or feature (e.g., `app/users`, `app/billing`, `app/auth`)?
* Are **services**, **API handlers**, **middleware**, and **UI components** clearly separated?
* Is business logic encapsulated in reusable **service modules**, not inside route handlers?
* Is the architecture easy to **extend**, **test**, and **scale**?

---

## üåê **API Design (RESTful Best Practices in Next.js API Routes)**

* Are RESTful conventions followed? (e.g., `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/auth/login`, etc.)
* Are route handlers **thin**, delegating to services or use cases?
* Is input validation enforced using a library like **Zod** or **Yup**?
* Are rate limits or abuse prevention (e.g., brute-force login attempts) implemented?
* Are APIs **versioned** (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to support future changes?

---

## üîê **Security (Critical for SaaS)**

* Are all secrets managed via `process.env` and not committed to source control?
* Is authentication implemented securely? (e.g., NextAuth.js, Clerk, or custom JWT strategy)
* Is **authorization enforced** at the API level (e.g., middleware to check roles/permissions)?
* Are public and private routes clearly separated in the UI and API?
* Is CSRF protection in place for POST/PUT/DELETE operations (especially if using cookies)?
* Are headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, etc., configured?

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Middleware & API Layer (with Next.js Edge/Server Functions)**

* Are reusable middleware functions used for auth, logging, and error handling?
* Is **Next.js Middleware** (`middleware.ts`) leveraged effectively for things like auth checks or geo redirects?
* Are Edge Functions or Serverless Functions used appropriately for latency-sensitive operations?

---

## üöÄ **Performance Optimization**

* Are Next.js optimizations used (e.g., dynamic imports, caching with `revalidate`, edge functions)?
* Are API responses cached when possible? (e.g., using `Cache-Control`, SWR, or stale-while-revalidate)
* Is DB access optimized (indexes in place, no N+1 queries)?
* Is the frontend using proper loading strategies (e.g., Suspense, skeleton loaders)?
* Is monitoring in place for performance bottlenecks?

---

## üì¶ **Scalability**

* Is the app deployed on a scalable platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda, Fly.io)?
* Is a **monorepo or modular architecture** in place to separate concerns (UI, API, core logic)?
* Are tenant-specific concerns (multi-tenancy) handled cleanly if needed for the SaaS model?
* Are third-party services like Stripe, Auth, and DB decoupled behind abstraction layers?

---

## üßæ **Error Handling**

* Are errors caught and logged systematically on both server and client?
* Is there a centralized error handler or logger (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket)?
* Are meaningful errors returned to the client (with appropriate HTTP status codes)?
* Are logs redacted of sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens)?

---

## üìä **Logging & Monitoring**

* Is structured logging in place for serverless functions?
* Is logging configured per environment (development vs production)?
* Are tools like **Sentry**, **Datadog**, **Logtail**, or **Vercel Analytics** integrated?

---

## üß™ **Testing**

* Are there automated tests for services, API routes, and edge logic? (Jest, Vitest, etc.)
* Is testing in place for auth flows, billing, and critical business logic?
* Is there end-to-end testing via **Playwright**, **Cypress**, or similar?

---

## üßπ **Code Quality & Developer Experience**

* Is TypeScript used with strict settings enabled?
* Is ESLint, Prettier, and Husky configured for consistent formatting and linting?
* Are code reviews enforced (if team-based)?
* Is the code easy to onboard onto?

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **CI/CD & Deployment**

* Is CI configured (GitHub Actions, Vercel CI) to run tests, linting, and builds?
* Are environments (dev/staging/prod) separated?
* Are preview deployments enabled (e.g., via Vercel)?
* Is monitoring tied to deploys for observability?

---

## üß† Suggest Fixes or Refactors If

* Logic is tightly coupled or duplicated across routes.
* Business rules exist in UI or API handlers instead of services.
* Error handling or validation is inconsistent or missing.
* APIs are not secured with proper auth/authz.
* Deployment or CI lacks robustness.
* There's tech debt or anti-patterns that would cause scaling issues.

---

## üîÑ Bonus: Recommend Best-in-Class Tools

You can optionally suggest best-in-class tools for:

* Auth (NextAuth.js, Clerk, Supabase Auth)
* DB (Prisma, PlanetScale, Neon)
* Billing (Stripe)
* Monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Vercel)
* Caching (Upstash Redis, SWR)
* Testing (Playwright, Vitest, Jest)
